In this project we are using PHP to create website, and SQL database to read and save the profile frome patients and doctors.

In the demo, we're using python to build a GUI program that asking patients about their information. Named Disease case entry system.
At Disease case entry system(DCES),The system will ask the patient to fill in the name, gender, age, and symptoms. Among them, select male or female for gender, and the symptoms text box provides a large text box for patients to fill in information. Finally fill it out and press the submit button

For the next step, we're going to create the database to set the program. At first, we trying to use python to connect the database. But we find out that the function is not simple to control and people don't know much about code cannot edit the program and profile. Finally, we change to using HTML, based on PHP to connect the database. On the one hand, it's more easy to build system; on the other hand, not only programmer, but also user can easily edit the system through to the web server.

So, for the futher support, we're going to use php to build system, and SQL, Apache to build the database. Then connect each other. After that, our system can easily to edit on web(localwebsite).
